        COMMENTING IS ONE SUCH PRACTICE THAT IS OFTEN IGNORED BY PROGRAMMERS, ESPECIALLY FOR CODES THAT ARE WRITTEN BY MULTIPLE PROGRAMMERS. BUT REMEMBER, COMMENTING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF PROJECT YOU CREATE. WITH PROPER COMMENTS AND ORGANISED FILES ITS ALWAYS EASIER FOR YOU OR OTHERS TO JUMP IN AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THINGS ARE AT AND HOW THEY WORK.
